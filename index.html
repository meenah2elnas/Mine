        <p>This isn't just a letter; it's a reminder of how incredible you are. I watched you this year [mention a struggle he overcame or a win], and I was so proud to call you mine.</p>
        <p>You are the most hardworking, handsome, and patient man I know. Whether you're riding horses or we're sharing a bowl of spaghetti, every moment with you is my favorite.</p>
        <p><strong>Tu es l'homme de mes rêves (the man of my dreams).</strong></p>
